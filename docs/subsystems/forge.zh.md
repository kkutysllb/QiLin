# Forge 能力

[English](forge.md) | 中文

实验性的 forge 能力 seam 从代码托管平台读取变更请求（change request，即 pull request 与 merge request）。[`qilin-experimental-forge`](../../packages/experimental/forge/README.zh.md) 是 Service Definition，提供 `ctx.forge`；[`qilin-experimental-forge-github`](../../packages/experimental/forge-github/README.zh.md) 是服务 GitHub 主机的 Service Provider；[`qilin-experimental-forge-session`](../../packages/experimental/forge-session/README.zh.md) 是把变更请求绑定到 Session 的 Consumer，提供 `ctx.forgeSession`。GUI 面板与组合这些包的 bundle 不属于当前组合。

## 提供方与变更请求

一个提供方服务一个 forge 家族，例如 `github`。它把 Git 远端 URL 映射为仓库，把变更请求 URL 映射为引用，构造规范的变更请求 URL，按 head 分支查找打开状态的变更请求，并批量读取状态。`changeRequestKey` 从引用派生一个不区分大小写的键，因此 URL 拼写不同的监听方共享同一个轮询循环。

```ts type-equiv
/** One repository on a code host, identified the way its provider addresses it. */
interface ForgeRepository {
  /** Provider family that serves the repository, such as `github`. */
  readonly forge: string
  /** Lowercase host name, such as `github.com`. */
  readonly host: string
  /** Owner or namespace path as the host spells it. */
  readonly owner: string
  /** Repository name as the host spells it. */
  readonly name: string
}
```

```ts type-equiv
/** One change request (pull request or merge request) in a repository. */
interface ChangeRequestRef {
  /** Repository that holds the change request. */
  readonly repository: ForgeRepository
  /** Host-assigned change request number. */
  readonly number: number
}
```

```ts type-equiv
/** Canonical identity of a change request across providers; built by `changeRequestKey`. */
type ChangeRequestKey = Branded<'ChangeRequestKey'>
```

```ts type-equiv
/**
 * Host-specific access registered with `ctx.forge`. One provider serves one
 * forge family; methods that take a signal must stop work when it aborts.
 */
interface ForgeProvider {
  /** Forge family name stored in every repository this provider returns. */
  readonly forge: string
  /** Map a Git remote URL to its repository, or undefined when this provider does not serve it. */
  repositoryFromRemote(url: string): ForgeRepository | undefined
  /** Map a change request web URL to its reference, or undefined when this provider does not serve it. */
  changeRequestFromUrl(url: string): ChangeRequestRef | undefined
  /** Build the canonical web URL of a change request this provider serves. */
  changeRequestUrl(ref: ChangeRequestRef): string
  /** Read the status of several change requests, returning one result per requested key. */
  fetch(
    refs: readonly ChangeRequestRef[],
    signal: AbortSignal,
  ): Promise<ReadonlyMap<ChangeRequestKey, ChangeRequestSnapshot | ForgeFailure>>
  /** Find open change requests whose head is `branch` in `repository`, excluding the default branch and forks. */
  findByHead(repository: ForgeRepository, branch: string, signal: AbortSignal): Promise<readonly ChangeRequestRef[]>
  /** Report whether the provider can reach `host` with current credentials. */
  readiness(host: string, signal: AbortSignal): Promise<ForgeReadiness>
  /** Mark a draft change request ready for review, resolving to undefined once the host accepted it. */
  markReady(ref: ChangeRequestRef, signal: AbortSignal): Promise<ForgeActionFailure | undefined>
  /** Merge a change request while its head is still `request.headSha`, resolving to undefined once merged. */
  merge(ref: ChangeRequestRef, request: MergeRequest, signal: AbortSignal): Promise<ForgeActionFailure | undefined>
  /** Read the changes of a change request as the host computes them, as one unified patch with `a/` and `b/` path prefixes. */
  diff(ref: ChangeRequestRef, signal: AbortSignal): Promise<string | ForgeFailure>
  /** Read the text of `path` at `commit` in the change request's repository. */
  fileText(ref: ChangeRequestRef, commit: string, path: string, signal: AbortSignal): Promise<string | ForgeFailure>
  /** Build the web page of `path` at `commit` in the change request's repository. */
  fileUrl(ref: ChangeRequestRef, commit: string, path: string): string
}
```

```ts type-equiv
/** Whether a provider can reach one host with the current credentials. */
interface ForgeReadiness {
  /** `ready`, `unauthenticated` (sign-in needed), or `unavailable` (tool missing or host unreachable). */
  readonly state: 'ready' | 'unauthenticated' | 'unavailable'
  /** Human-readable detail, or null when ready. */
  readonly message: string | null
}
```

## 状态轮询

`ctx.forge.watch` 让同一变更请求的所有监听方共享一个轮询循环，并把每次结果作为更新送达。每个 forge 同时最多只有一次读取在进行。轮询节奏、退避与超时规则见[注册表 README](../../packages/experimental/forge/README.zh.md#use-this-package)。

```ts type-equiv
/** Lifecycle state of a change request. */
type ChangeRequestState = 'open' | 'closed' | 'merged'
```

```ts type-equiv
/** Normalized outcome of one status check. */
type CheckState = 'pending' | 'success' | 'failure' | 'neutral' | 'skipped' | 'cancelled'
```

```ts type-equiv
/** One status check reported for the head commit of a change request. */
interface ChangeRequestCheck {
  /** Check name as the host displays it. */
  readonly name: string
  /** Normalized check outcome. */
  readonly state: CheckState
  /** Web page for the check, or null when the host reports none. */
  readonly url: string | null
  /** Workflow that produced the check, or null when the host reports none. */
  readonly workflow: string | null
  /** ISO 8601 time the check started, or null before it starts and when the host reports none. */
  readonly startedAt: string | null
  /** ISO 8601 time the check completed, or null while it runs and when the host reports none. */
  readonly completedAt: string | null
}
```

```ts type-equiv
/** Combined outcome of all checks on the head commit. */
type ChecksRollup = 'none' | 'pending' | 'success' | 'failure'
```

```ts type-equiv
/** Whether the change request can merge into its base without conflicts. */
type Mergeability = 'mergeable' | 'conflicting' | 'unknown'
```

```ts type-equiv
/** Aggregate review outcome required by the host's merge rules. */
type ReviewDecision = 'approved' | 'changes-requested' | 'review-required' | 'none'
```

```ts type-equiv
/** Status of one change request at the time its provider read it. */
interface ChangeRequestSnapshot {
  /** Change request the snapshot describes. */
  readonly ref: ChangeRequestRef
  /** Web page of the change request. */
  readonly url: string
  /** Title as the author wrote it. */
  readonly title: string
  /** Lifecycle state. */
  readonly state: ChangeRequestState
  /** Whether the author marked the change request as a draft. */
  readonly draft: boolean
  /** Author login, or null when the host hides it. */
  readonly author: string | null
  /** Branch that carries the proposed commits. */
  readonly headBranch: string
  /** Commit object name at the head of the change request. */
  readonly headSha: string
  /** Branch the change request merges into. */
  readonly baseBranch: string
  /** Lines the change request adds. */
  readonly additions: number
  /** Lines the change request deletes. */
  readonly deletions: number
  /** Merge conflict status; `unknown` while the host computes it. */
  readonly mergeability: Mergeability
  /**
   * Whether the host would merge the change request now for the signed-in
   * user: open, not a draft, and meeting the base branch's merge rules.
   */
  readonly mergeReady: boolean
  /** Merge methods the repository accepts, the signed-in user's usual one first. */
  readonly mergeMethods: readonly MergeMethod[]
  /** Aggregate review outcome. */
  readonly reviewDecision: ReviewDecision
  /** Checks on the head commit in host order. */
  readonly checks: readonly ChangeRequestCheck[]
  /** Combined check outcome. */
  readonly checksRollup: ChecksRollup
  /** Whether the host reported more checks than `checks` contains. */
  readonly checksTruncated: boolean
  /** Number of review threads that are not resolved. */
  readonly unresolvedThreads: number
  /** ISO 8601 time of the host's last update to the change request. */
  readonly updatedAt: string
  /** ISO 8601 time the change request was merged or closed, or null while it is open. */
  readonly closedAt: string | null
}
```

```ts type-equiv
/** Why a provider could not read a change request. */
interface ForgeFailure {
  /**
   * `not-found`: the host does not expose it; `unauthenticated`: credentials are missing or rejected;
   * `too-large`: the host or the provider refuses an answer over its size limit, so reading again fails
   * the same way; `unavailable`: any other failure.
   */
  readonly code: 'not-found' | 'unauthenticated' | 'too-large' | 'unavailable'
  /** Human-readable cause. */
  readonly message: string
}
```

```ts type-equiv
/** Latest polling result delivered to watchers of one change request. */
type ChangeRequestUpdate = {
  /** Canonical identity of the watched change request. */
  readonly key: ChangeRequestKey
  /** Epoch milliseconds when the result settled. */
  readonly fetchedAt: number
} & ({
  /** Status read from the host. */
  readonly snapshot: ChangeRequestSnapshot
} | {
  /** Reason the status could not be read. */
  readonly failure: ForgeFailure
})
```

```ts type-equiv
/**
 * Receives every polling result for one watched change request.
 * @param update - the settled result.
 */
type ChangeRequestListener = (update: ChangeRequestUpdate) => void
```

## 变更请求操作

`ctx.forge.markReady` 把草稿标记为可评审，`ctx.forge.merge` 只在 head 仍是用户确认的提交时合并变更请求。主机拒绝时，两者都 resolve 为 `ForgeActionFailure` 而不是抛错，并在结束后立即轮询被监听的变更请求。快照的 `mergeReady` 与 `mergeMethods` 告诉消费方何时提供合并、可用哪些合并方式；GitHub 如何给出这两项由 [GitHub 提供方 README](../../packages/experimental/forge-github/README.zh.md#use-this-package) 说明。

```ts type-equiv
/** A merge the user confirmed for the head commit they saw. */
interface MergeRequest {
  /** How the commits enter the base branch. */
  readonly method: MergeMethod
  /** Commit object name the head must still have; the merge is refused once the head moves. */
  readonly headSha: string
}
```

```ts type-equiv
/** Why a provider could not change a change request. */
interface ForgeActionFailure {
  /**
   * `unauthenticated`: credentials are missing or rejected; `stale`: the head
   * moved past the confirmed commit; `failed`: the host refused or could not be reached.
   */
  readonly code: 'unauthenticated' | 'stale' | 'failed'
  /** Human-readable cause, usually the host's own message. */
  readonly message: string
}
```

## Session 绑定

`ctx.forgeSession` 从每个 Session 自己的日志派生其绑定：`gh pr create` 的结果绑定其输出的 URL，`gh pr view`、`gh pr edit` 与 `gh pr checkout` 调用绑定它们所操作的变更请求，`git push` 的结果通过 `ctx.forge` 触发按 head 分支的发现。track、dismiss 与发现操作都是 `plugin:forge-session/binding` 插件记录，位于模型可见对话之外。`forgeChangeRequests` 投影的客户端视图随 Session 摘要下发，列出绑定但不含其状态。识别与发现规则见 [Session 绑定 README](../../packages/experimental/forge-session/README.zh.md#use-this-package)。

```ts type-equiv
/**
 * How a change request became bound to a Session: `created` when a
 * `gh pr create` result printed its URL, `referenced` when a `gh pr view`,
 * `gh pr edit`, or `gh pr checkout` call named it or its result printed its
 * own URL, `discovered` when a lookup found it for a branch the Session pushed
 * or works on, `tracked` when a caller bound it by URL.
 */
type BindingOrigin = 'created' | 'referenced' | 'discovered' | 'tracked'
```

```ts type-equiv
/** Payload of the `plugin:forge-session/binding` record. */
interface BindingRecord {
  /**
   * `track` binds or restores, `dismiss` hides, `discover` binds a branch lookup,
   * and `reference` binds a CLI selector lookup without restoring dismissed entries.
   */
  readonly action: 'track' | 'dismiss' | 'discover' | 'reference'
  /** Web URL of the change request. */
  readonly url: string
}
```

```ts type-equiv
/** One change request bound to a Session and not dismissed, with its latest polling result. */
interface SessionChangeRequest {
  /** Web URL as first recorded. */
  readonly url: string
  /** How the change request became bound. */
  readonly origin: BindingOrigin
  /** Parsed reference, or null when no registered provider serves the URL. */
  readonly ref: ChangeRequestRef | null
  /** Latest polling result, or null before the first poll and without a provider. */
  readonly update: ChangeRequestUpdate | null
}
```

```ts type-equiv
/**
 * Receives the complete visible list after a binding or provider change, or a polling result.
 * @param changeRequests - every visible binding of the watched Session, in first-recorded order.
 */
type SessionChangeRequestsListener = (changeRequests: readonly SessionChangeRequest[]) => void
```

### `ctx.forgeSession` — `ForgeSessionService`

Session-scoped change request bindings. The `forgeChangeRequests` projection derives them from `gh pr create`, `gh pr view`, `gh pr edit`, `gh pr checkout`, and `git push` results and from `plugin:forge-session/binding` records. After each push result, and when a caller reports the branch a Session works on, the service looks up open change requests whose head is that branch and records the unbound ones as discovered. Watching a Session polls its visible change requests through `ctx.forge`.

```ts cordis-catalog
/**
 * List the change requests bound to a Session and not dismissed.
 * @param session - Session whose bindings are read.
 * @returns visible bindings in first-recorded order, each with its latest polling result.
 */
changeRequests(session: Session): SessionChangeRequest[]

/**
 * Bind a change request to a Session by URL, or restore a dismissed binding.
 * Appends a `track` record with the provider's canonical URL unless the
 * change request is already visible.
 * @param session - Session that receives the binding.
 * @param url - web URL of the change request.
 * @throws when no registered provider recognizes the URL.
 */
track(session: Session, url: string): void

/**
 * Look up open change requests whose head is a branch the Session works on,
 * and record the unbound ones as discovered, as after a push of that branch.
 * A remote that no provider recognizes changes nothing; a failed lookup is
 * logged and changes nothing.
 * @param session - Session that receives the bindings.
 * @param remote - URL of the remote that holds the branch.
 * @param branch - branch name on that remote.
 * @returns resolves once the lookup has recorded its bindings or failed.
 */
discoverBranch(session: Session, remote: string, branch: string): Promise<void>

/**

 * visibly bound leaves the log unchanged. Discovery never restores a

 */
