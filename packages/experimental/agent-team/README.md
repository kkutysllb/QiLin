# @qilin-agent/experimental-agent-team

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

## Summary

`qilin-experimental-agent-team` turns one coding session into a small working team: the session's agent becomes the Lead, creates named teammates for delegated work, exchanges durable messages with them, and tracks shared tasks on a common board. Messages and task state survive crashes, reloads, and interruptions: a message steered at an offline teammate cold-resumes it, and the message is durable in that teammate's own log. It provides no tools of its own — mount the sibling `qilin-experimental-tool-agent-team` so the model can create teammates, message them, and use the task board. It is published under its experimental name, carries no stability promise, and needs durable session storage to activate.

## Use this package

Add this package to a composition when one agent should run a small team of named helpers in its own working directory, with messages and task state that survive crashes and restarts. It ships no tools of its own: mount it together with `@qilin-agent/experimental-tool-agent-team` so the model can create teammates, message them, and use the task board.

### When to choose it

Choose it when several agents must cooperate on one shared workspace and their roster, messages, and task state must survive crashes and restarts. Avoid it when teammates need separate working directories, when several processes must coordinate over one team, or when a task owner should be released automatically — none of those are supported. The team features need durable session storage to activate.

### Smallest working setup

<a id="smallest-working-setup"></a>

The smallest addition to an existing composition is durable session storage plus both Team packages:

```yaml
# smallest team setup — durable storage plus both Team packages
- name: '@qilin-agent/session-persistence-jsonl'
- name: '@qilin-agent/experimental-agent-team'
- name: '@qilin-agent/experimental-tool-agent-team'
```

With the tools installed, the model does the rest on request — for example, "create a teammate named reviewer to check the diff", then "send reviewer the change summary". All limits are optional and validated at startup:

| Field | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `maxMembers` | `16` | Maximum teammates a team may ever create, including failed ones |
| `maxTasks` | `256` | Maximum active tasks on the board |
| `maxMessageBytes` | `65,536` | Maximum size of one sent message |
| `disposalTimeoutMs` | `5,000` | Time allowed for shutdown cleanup |

The generated [configuration catalog](../../../docs/config-catalog.md#qilin-agentexperimental-agent-team) is the exhaustive source for every accepted field and its JSDoc.

### Teammates

Ask the Lead to create a teammate: give it a unique lowercase name such as `reviewer` and describe its job. A teammate starts fresh with no memory of the Lead's conversation, or as a fork that inherits the Lead's completed turns; the creation request chooses which. Teammate names are permanent — even a teammate whose creation failed keeps its name, and no name is ever reused.

The roster shows every member with its role (`lead` or `teammate`) and current status: `running`, `idle`, `inactive` (a member that exists but is not loaded), `provisioning`, or `failed`. A member that is not loaded receives its messages when it wakes.

Only the Lead can create teammates or interrupt them.

### Messages between teammates

Any member can send a message to any other member or to the Lead. A live member receives it at its next step boundary; an idle or inactive member is started or cold-resumed so the message still arrives. The message becomes durable in the target's own Session log, so it survives a crash between delivery and model processing.

Every message uses Steer: a running target receives it at the nearest step boundary, an idle target starts a turn, and an inactive teammate cold-resumes. The sender either sees the accepted message id or one specific rejection: an unknown target name, a self-addressed message, an oversized message, or cancellation before acceptance. A successful send is already durable, so it must never be resent.

### Shared task board

Any member can add a task with a title, details, optional dependencies on other tasks, and optional hints about which files it will touch. A task is claimable only when everything it depends on is complete.

Tasks have an owner: a member claims a task to start work, completes it when done, releases it back, or reopens it; the Lead can assign a task to any member. Every change is compare-and-set: an update based on an outdated copy is rejected, so two members cannot silently overwrite each other's work.

File hints produce warnings when two in-progress tasks plan to touch overlapping paths — they never block anything. Deleted tasks remain in history but disappear from the active list.

### Waiting and interruption

A member can wait for the next team change — a teammate's status, an incoming message, or a task update — instead of polling repeatedly; the wait reports only whether it timed out, and the caller re-reads the current state afterward.

The Lead can stop a teammate's current turn without deleting messages already in its inbox; task ownership is unchanged.

### What success and failure look like

Success looks like a teammate appearing in the roster, a message reporting its accepted id, and task revisions advancing with each change. Likely failures are reported as specific errors instead of silently corrupting state: sending to a name that is not a member, claiming a task that is not ready, editing with an outdated revision, or creating a teammate beyond the member limit.

## Understand the implementation

<details>
<summary>Implementation internals — click to expand</summary>

This section explains the design decisions behind the service and points at the code that realizes them; the observable behavior is fully covered in [Use this package](#use-this-package).

### Design philosophy

The service is built on one separation and three commitments:

- **Durable log, derived state.** The Lead Session log is the single source of truth; roster, message, and task state are replayed from it on every read.
- **Process-local ownership.** All coordination lives in one process; the guarantee is retry plus de-duplication, never cross-process consensus.
- **Explicit authority.** Every service method takes the exact live calling `Agent`; only the Lead spawns, reassigns, or interrupts.
- **Bounds that fail loud.** Every limit is a validated deployment value, and exhaustion reports a typed error instead of reusing an id or name.

The [Agent Teams Agent Note](../../../.agents/notes/implemented/feature/2026-08-05-agent-teams.md) owns the identity, mailbox, task, and shared-checkout decisions.

### Source map

| [`src/roster.ts`](src/roster.ts) | Team identity, membership resolution, provisioning, and roster teardown |
| [`src/task-board.ts`](src/task-board.ts) | Task CAS commands, DAG validation, and derived views |

| [`src/projection.ts`](src/projection.ts) | Strict replay projection that decodes and validates Team events and publishes the `agentTeam` client view |
| [`src/remote.ts`](src/remote.ts) | Browser write-bridge face: wire error mapping and the `RemoteErrorDetailsMap` Team augmentation |
| [`src/task-view.ts`](src/task-view.ts) | Pure task readiness, owner-name, and write-overlap derivation shared by the task board and the client view |
| [`src/activity.ts`](src/activity.ts) | One-shot change waiters and disposal release |
| [`src/lifecycle.ts`](src/lifecycle.ts) | Shared admission cutoff and bounded settlement |

### Team identity and roster

Every ordinary runtime root is the implicit Lead of a Team whose `TeamId` equals its `SessionId`; there is no creation event, and durable state begins with the first member, message, or task record. `spawnTeammate()` first appends and flushes a `provisioning` member record, then asks the configured provider to create the reserved child; a provider failure appends a durable `failed` member. A fresh child starts with no Lead history; a fork child captures the Lead's completed-turn prefix once. Recovery reconciles an unterminated provisioning record against the child's independently persisted Session: a matching direct-parent and continuable descriptor plus a recorded initial user message produces `active`, and anything else produces `failed`. If recovery wins a same-process race, the creator accepts the terminal state or reports `TEAM_PROVISIONING_CONFLICT` and drains the child. Names are reserved by the first provisioning record and never reused.

### Direct steering

`sendMessage()` validates peer membership, resolves the target, mints the message identity, and measures the framed content against `maxMessageBytes` before anything is delivered. The target message begins with `Team message <id> from <name>:` and keeps the same id and sender in `TeamMessageSource`, so the receiving model and the durable log agree on the sender's identity. Lead delivery calls `Agent.steer()` directly; teammate delivery uses the continuation owner's host-only Steer path, which authorizes the Lead-to-child edge and cold-resumes inactive targets. A send that cannot be admitted fails with its own error instead of being retained, so the sender never has to reason about a retry queue.

Sibling messages never impersonate the Lead through the public adjacent-Agent messaging operation.

### Shared task board

Tasks are complete versioned snapshots; every mutation carries `expectedRevision`, and a stale caller receives `TEAM_TASK_STALE_REVISION` instead of overwriting a newer value. Numeric `task-<n>` ids require a safe-integer suffix, and id-space exhaustion reports `TEAM_TASK_LIMIT` instead of reusing the final id. Deleted tasks remain tombstones for replay and id stability but do not consume `maxTasks` or appear in `listTasks()`. `writeScopes` are normalized workspace-relative prefixes; views warn on overlap with in-progress tasks but never block claim or authorize writes.

### Waiting and interruption

`waitForChange()` waits for one roster, task, message, or live-status edge that occurs after registration, from ten seconds through one hour, and reports only whether it timed out; runtime disposal releases current waits. Cancellation preserves an Error reason or reports a non-Error reason through `TEAM_WAIT_ABORTED`. `interrupt()` is Lead-only and delegates to the continuable-subagent interrupt path, which cancels only a live teammate's current turn with `keepInbox`; it neither releases task ownership nor deletes durable mail.

### Durability model

Team events are appended to the exact live Lead Session and flushed before the operation reports success or wakes waiters. `team/member` and `team/task` are log-only, and the historical `team/message/queued` and `team/message/delivered` records stay readable: none of them enters the conversation surface, so derived model history is untouched by coordination records. Session event `seq` and `time` own ordering and timing; snapshots do not duplicate them.

### Disposal

Disposal closes admission, aborts and awaits admitted send and creation transactions, then asks the continuation owner to release the roster's exact live direct children and their descendants; non-Team continuable children of the Lead remain untouched. Cleanup failures make disposal fail visibly, bounded by `disposalTimeoutMs`.

### Browser projection

The `agentTeam` Session projection publishes the Lead Session's durable roster identities and phases, member errors, non-deleted task views, and any `failure` beside the last valid state. Its `apply` replaces only the touched collection; mailbox-only changes retain the client view reference and produce no frame. The [subsystem reference](../../../docs/subsystems/agent-team.md#web-projection) defines the wire types.

The [Web UI](../client-ui-agent-team/README.md) reads the shared Session projections and overlays activity from Session status. The `./client` export supplies browser-safe roster, task, and projection types.

### Browser write bridge

The service exposes two wire methods on the `agentTeams` Typert namespace — `createTask` and `updateTask` — the direct wire face of the same-named service operations. `updateTask` carries every board mutation the browser offers as a typed action: `edit`, `complete`, `reopen`, `delete`, `reassign`, and `set_dependencies`. The wire caller is the exact live conversation agent; because the Web conversation prompt path runs as the Lead, the browser always writes with Lead authority, and a teammate conversation resolves its writes to the Lead before calling. Domain refusals map onto the shared Remote vocabulary through `src/remote.ts`: `TEAM_TASK_STALE_REVISION` becomes `agent-team/stale-revision`, a non-member caller becomes `agent-team/not-a-member`, and every other Team error becomes `agent-team/rejected` carrying the originating Team code in its details. The same file augments `RemoteErrorDetailsMap` with the Team codes so browser consumers branch on them type-safely. Read paths stay on the `agentTeam` projection; the bridge adds no model-visible input.

## Model Experience

### Peer messages

#### What the model sees

Each delivered peer message is a user-role message. A short first text block names its stable message id and sender; the sender's original content blocks follow unchanged. Roster, task, and mailbox records are log-only and never enter derived model history.

#### Token effect

Each peer delivery adds the sender prefix plus message content to the target history. Task and roster mutations add no model tokens; their model-facing representation belongs to `@qilin-agent/experimental-tool-agent-team` results.

#### KV Cache effect

Peer messages append after the target's reusable history prefix. Cold resume reuses the persisted conversation before appending a previously undelivered item.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

<a id="known-limitations-and-deferred-work"></a>


These limits describe what a team cannot do yet or what needs special operational care. They are current package constraints, not a comparison with other coordination mechanisms.

- **Whole-view broadcasts** — each roster or task change sends the complete roster and non-deleted task board, including descriptions, to every connected browser, even when it is viewing another Session.
- **Experimental prototype with no stability promise** — the package is public, but its contracts can change freely while it incubates.
- **One process and one shared checkout** — members share cwd and observe edits immediately; this package provides no worktree, remote member, merge, or filesystem lock.
- **Advisory write scopes** — Bash, formatters, code generators, and direct external writers can bypass filesystem version checks; Leads must coordinate ownership and review the final diff.
- **Flat immutable roster** — only the Lead creates direct teammates; there is no nested Team, rename, deletion, or name reuse.
- **No automatic ownership release** — idle, interruption, process exit, and failed work do not release a task owner.
- **Mailbox is not cross-process exactly-once** — concurrent harness processes over one Team are unsupported.

### Dev Note

<details>
<summary>Working context for maintainers — click to expand</summary>

This Dev Note is working context for maintainers and is explicitly non-authoritative.

#### Promotion

Promotion to a product-role group requires reviewing the public contract, limitations, test evidence, release payload, runtime dependents, and a named stable owner, per the [experimental subtree rules](../AGENTS.md).

#### Future directions

Undecided directions include nested Teams, automatic ownership release policies, cross-process mailbox transactions, and filesystem isolation via worktrees; none of these are committed.
