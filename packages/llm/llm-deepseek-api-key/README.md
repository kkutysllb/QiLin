# @qilin-agent/llm-deepseek-api-key

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

## Summary

Register authentication, model discovery, and the official model listing for `deepseek-official`. This plugin shares the [Messages transport](../llm-deepseek/README.md) and owns credential resolution, catalog availability, and model admission.

Authentication resolution returns the validated API key in `x-api-key` for both Messages and Files requests.

## Use this package

`apiKeyEnv` defaults to `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` and resolves per request. When the credentials service exists, its precedence applies; only compositions without that service read the launch environment directly. Requests with missing credentials fail with `MISSING_CREDENTIAL`; malformed credentials fail with `INVALID_CREDENTIAL`. Model discovery returns the configured catalog regardless of credentials.

```yaml
- id: llm-deepseek
  name: '@qilin-agent/llm-deepseek-api-key'
  config:
    reasoningEffort: high
    apiKeyEnv: DEEPSEEK_API_KEY
```

The endpoint and credential reference come from one configuration resolution. In-flight requests retain that snapshot; subsequent updates affect subsequent calls. Account login state cannot change this route’s credential.

`models` is an independently configurable catalog for this provider; defaults and protocol capabilities come from the shared transport. While `models` equals the built-in catalog and the Messages origin is the official API, `https://api.deepseek.com`, the route serves the official `GET https://api.deepseek.com/models` listing instead. Listing requests carry the API key in `x-api-key` and the harness `User-Agent`, and reject redirects; without an API key the route requests nothing. Any other endpoint, including one named by `baseURL` or `$DEEPSEEK_BASE_URL`, serves `models` and requests no listing. Discovery does not probe inference endpoints.

The first access waits for the listing up to `modelsTimeoutMs`. Later accesses use the loaded listing and refresh it in the background once it is older than `modelsMaxAgeMs`; an idle route sends no requests. A failed or empty listing keeps the previous one; before any listing loads, the route serves the built-in catalog of the current version (`deepseek-flash` and `deepseek-v4-pro`). A listing HTTP 401 fails only that load. Each loaded listing, the first failure of a failing streak with the catalog it falls back to, and each listing entry hidden because its declarations are unreadable or unusable are written to stderr with the `[llm-deepseek-api-key]` tag; stdout remains available for protocol messages, and secrets are never logged.

Listed models are offered, merged with this build's entries, and refused before network I/O with `CLIENT_UPGRADE_REQUIRED` or `MODEL_UNSUPPORTED`; a listed entry declares its client requirement under this build's product token or the upstream `deepseek-harness` token, this build's token first. Model ids the listing does not name pass through unchanged.

A `models` list that differs from the built-in catalog replaces the catalog and stops listing requests; the Models page stores an edited catalog there. Removing that list, as **Restore defaults** on the Models page does, returns the route to the listing, and the next access loads the listing again even when the cached one is still fresh. A list identical to the built-in catalog counts as uncustomized.

| Field | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `modelsTimeoutMs` | `5,000` | Deadline of one listing request and of a first-access wait |
| `modelsMaxAgeMs` | `600,000` | Listing age after which the next access refreshes it; a failed load retries after the same age |

The settings namespace is the Cordis entry id, or the plugin name without an entry. Product profiles retain the official entry id `llm-deepseek`.

## Understand the implementation

Registrations and listeners dispose with the plugin, and disposal aborts an in-flight listing request. Shared Host wiring supplies attachments, request extensions, anonymous identity, and atomic retry-policy updates; this plugin registers only its own route and uses the transport's `connect` and `admit` hooks for the listed catalog and the gate. The listing request, its cache, and catalog resolution come from the shared transport; the cache lives in memory and is keyed by endpoint and a SHA-256 of the key, so another key loads its own listing. A `loader/volatile-update` listener discards the cached listing whenever the route starts or stops following it.

## Model Experience

### Authenticated model requests

#### What the model sees

Requests on `deepseek-official` add no model-visible text from this plugin; the shared Messages transport serializes requests.

#### Token effect

Authentication and discovery add no input tokens; the selected model and request content determine actual usage.

#### KV Cache effect

Credentials and catalog availability do not enter model input; the protocol transport owns request-prefix serialization.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

<a id="known-limitations-and-deferred-work"></a>

- The catalog is configuration metadata, not remote validation that a model is accepted; actual calls can still fail.

### Dev Note

Registration and authentication tests also cover the Loader composition in the shared transport package.
