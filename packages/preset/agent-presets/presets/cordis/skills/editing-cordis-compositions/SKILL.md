description: Use when creating, changing, or validating a Kylin composition for this harness — writing or editing an agent preset, adding or removing a plugin row, deciding whether something belongs to the host composition or to one session, checking whether a preset you authored actually mounts, or diagnosing a row that mounted but contributed nothing.

# Editing Kylin compositions

Every capability in this harness is a plugin row in a `cordis.yml`. There is no separate configuration language: changing what an agent can do means changing which rows are composed for it. Load `cordis-composition-reference` for the Loader patch dialect and the list of plugin packages a preset can mount.

## Off-limits

**Never edit, delete, or overwrite a preset that ships with the deployment** — the `agent-presets` directory beside the deployment's own config, which supplies `standard`, `ptc`, `minimal`, and `cordis`. Never escalate the sandbox to reach it, even when a change there looks quicker. An upgrade overwrites that install, and corrupting `cordis` disables preset authoring itself. Reading a shipped composition is the intended way to start; writing to one is not, and neither is editing the host composition to work around a preset limitation.

To change what a shipped preset does, copy it and edit the copy. Locally authored presets under the user root are yours to create, edit, and delete.

## Decide the plane first

Two planes, and the choice is not about how "agent-related" something feels — it is about whether the thing must be shared.

**Host composition.** The registries themselves (`tools`, `systemPrompt`, `agents`, `agent-loop`, `sessions`), anything crossing sessions (persistence, session query, storage, settings, credentials, telemetry), the sandbox and approval stack, the model route, and the subagent registry with its spawn/fork backends. One instance for the process.

**Agent preset.** What one session contributes to those registries: its tool plugins, its persona and prompt sections, its compaction policy. A preset is mounted once per process as a standing composition, and the sessions that select it join that mount, so its registrations and listeners cover every joined session and no other preset's.

**A service with a consumer outside the agent plane cannot move into a preset.** `subagents` is the worked example: the registry answers cross-session queries for the host api-proxy, so a per-session copy both starves that host row — it waits forever for a service nothing provides — and collides on the second session, since a provider name registers once. The preset contributes the delegation *tools*; the registry and its backends stay host-side.

A preset is a directory holding one `agent.cordis.yml`, optionally beside a `preset.yml` carrying display metadata — `name` and `description` (and, for shipped presets, a roster `order`). Write the metadata too: a preset without it shows up in every picker as its bare directory name.

Locally authored presets live one directory per preset under `${QILIN_HOME:-$HOME/.qilin}/.agent-presets/`, and the shipped set sits beside the deployment's own config. Use those when the user asks where to look. For deployment overrides, read `${QILIN_HOME:-$HOME/.qilin}/profiles/<profile>/cordis.patch.yml`, `${QILIN_HOME:-$HOME/.qilin}/cordis.patch.yml`, and any launch `--patch` files for the `agent-presets` row's `roots` and `includeUserRoot`. Obtain the active profile and extra patch paths from the user when they are not in the task context; do not guess a different profile.

## Authoring a preset

Use shell and file tools to locate the installed `@qilin-agent/agent-presets` package under the active profile's `node_modules` or the deployment installation. Its `presets/<id>/` directory contains each shipped preset. If those files are unavailable, ask the user to copy the preset through the Web preset picker and provide the copied directory; runtime API inspection does not execute Remote methods. When this section leaves a question open, read the `@qilin-agent/agent-presets` README and `lib/types` declarations under that package directory; the roster's Loader row id is `agent-presets`.

Copy the complete source directory, including skills and assets, into a new `${QILIN_HOME:-$HOME/.qilin}/.agent-presets/<new-id>/` directory (or the explicitly configured writable root). Refuse an existing destination. Set `name` and `description` in `preset.yml` and remove the copied roster `order`. Never overwrite the installed source.

Edit the copy's `agent.cordis.yml` with the normal file tools. Writes outside the workspace follow the active filesystem approval policy. For profile-wide capabilities, author a workspace bundle and install it with `plugin_manager`; load `cordis-plugin-development` for packaging guidance.

## Service isolation

A preset row that publishes a service needs an `isolate` realm containing both the provider and all its consumers. A tool that only consumes a host service remains outside that realm. Copy the shipped preset's existing groups rather than introducing service instances into the process-global realm.

```yaml
- id: delegation
  name: cordis:group
  group: true
  isolate:
    workflowEngine: true
  config:
    - id: workflow-ptc
      name: '@qilin-agent/workflow-ptc'
      config:
        provider: spawn
    - id: tool-workflow
      name: '@qilin-agent/tool-workflow'
```

Scope controls contributions and event visibility; `isolate` controls service instances. Use ordinary Cordis groups for nested plugin lists, keep `!!js` expressions only in plugin configuration or `disabled`, and resolve assets from installed packages rather than from a preset directory.

## Verify a preset

Check the edited YAML and referenced local files with file tools. Ask the user to select the new preset in the Web picker and start a session; this authoring agent cannot invoke the preset Remote API or start a Web session through inspection. Once the user provides a running session or browser control, inspect the visible tools and any activation diagnostic. File validation alone does not verify imports, service dependencies, or isolation. Report which checks ran and leave activation unverified until that session check succeeds.

A preset whose composition is missing, unparsable, or names a module that cannot be resolved is listed on the roster with its reason and cannot compose a session; fix the file or delete the preset, then retry. Sessions already running on the previous composition keep the generation they started with, so validate changed behavior in a new session. Installing a bundle executes plugin code in the Host process, so it needs Full access or approval.

## Native product subagents

Codex and Claude Code providers are independent optional Profile Bundles, and a preset separately grants one Agent its ordinary delegation tool. Install only the products a Profile needs and restart it so its Host registers those providers. Read `references/native-product-subagents.md` for the install commands, the disabled row templates, and the rules for named instances.

## What not to move into a preset

`agent-loop` registers the one agent factory and throws on a second. The registries own the per-session layering and cannot themselves be per-session. Session persistence must stay host-side or the session list fragments. The sandbox, approval, and permission rows are a deliberate boundary: a preset is exactly as privileged as the plugins it names, so letting one relax its own confinement would defeat the confinement.
