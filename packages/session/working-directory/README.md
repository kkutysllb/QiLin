## Summary

Change one Session’s working directory while existing processes retain theirs. The selected directory survives replay and appears in user context. A missing directory restores the original project when it remains available.

## Use this package

Mount alongside `fs`, `sessionProjections`, and `systemPrompt`. `defaultDirectory` selects an absolute fallback for Sessions without an original directory; omission uses the launch directory. See the [configuration catalog](../../../docs/config-catalog.md).

```yaml
- name: '@qilin-agent/working-directory'
```

<a id="understand-the-implementation"></a>
## Understand the implementation

The Session projection owns the effective directory and exposes it in Session observations, so cold readers can use it without activating an Agent; the header continues to identify the original project. Changes serialize per Session, validate through the filesystem provider, check cancellation and Agent lifetime, commit an event, and queue a user-context notice. If notice queuing fails after commit, the operation returns the committed directory and logs a warning; the next request or resume still receives the required directory context. Prompt assembly validates the current directory before publishing its context contribution. Existing processes and sandbox grants keep their independent ownership. The [service implementation](src/index.ts) defines the API.

## Model Experience

### Working directory context

#### What the model sees

The current value is `Current working directory: <JSON-quoted absolute path>.` The contribution is registered as required and literal: it survives disabled or suppressed optional runtime context, its text is never interpolated as prompt variables, and `refreshContext()` re-resolves it at request admission so a change made after assembly still reaches the same request. Each committed change, including automatic recovery, attempts to queue a user-context notice through the ordinary Agent inbox. Cancellation or disposal may discard unadmitted notices; the durable directory remains available to the next request.

#### Token effect

The initial snapshot and changed values add user-context tokens; unchanged snapshots are not repeated.

#### KV Cache effect

Directory transitions append context without replacing the stable system-prompt prefix. A changed directory or recovery creates new context after retained history.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

<a id="known-limitations-and-deferred-work"></a>

- **Missing original project** — when the current directory and the original project are both unavailable, prompt assembly rejects every model turn, including chat-only turns. The service does not choose or recreate a repository. Restore the original directory, or use SDK `setWorkingDirectory` (or `ctx.workingDirectory.set`) to select an existing absolute directory before retrying. Existing shells retain their process-local directories.
